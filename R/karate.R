#' Zachary's karate club network
#'
#' @description
#'
#'   Social network between members of a university karate club, led by
#'   president John A. and karate instructor Mr. Hi (pseudonyms).
#'
#'   The edge weights are the number of common activities the club
#'   members took part of. These activities were:
#'   \enumerate{
#'     \item Association in and between academic classes at the university.
#'     \item Membership in Mr. Hi's private karate studio on the east side
#'     of the city where Mr. Hi taught nights as a part-time instructor.
#'     \item Membership in Mr. Hi's private karate studio on the east side
#'     of the city, where many of his supporters worked out on weekends.
#'     \item Student teaching at the east-side karate studio referred to in
#'     (2). This is different from (2) in that student teachers interacted
#'     with each other, but were prohibited from interacting with their
#'     students.
#'     \item Interaction at the university rathskeller, located in the same
#'     basement as the karate club's workout area.
#'     \item Interaction at a student-oriented bar located across the
#'     street from the university campus.
#'     \item Attendance at open karate tournaments held through the area at
#'     private karate studios.
#'     \item Attendance at intercollegiate karate tournaments held at local
#'     universities. Since both open and intercollegiate tournaments were
#'     held on Saturdays, attendance at both was impossible.

#'   Zachary studied conflict and fission in this network, as the karate
#'   club was split into two separate clubs, after long disputes between
#'   two factions of the club, one led by John A., the other by Mr. Hi.
#'
#'   The \sQuote{Faction} vertex attribute gives the faction memberships of
#'   the actors. After the split of the club, club members chose their
#'   new clubs based on their factions, except actor no. 9, who was in John
#'   A.'s faction but chose Mr. Hi's club.
