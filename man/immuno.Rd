\description{
The undirected and connected network of interactions
in the immunoglobulin protein. It is made up of 1316 vertices
representing amino-acids and an edge is drawn between two
amino-acids if the shortest distance between their C_alpha atoms
is smaller than the threshold value \eqn{\theta=8}{theta=8} Angstrom.
